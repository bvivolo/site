                        <h1 class="fw-bold mb-4">About Me</h1>
                        <p class="mb-4">Hello!</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">My name is Brian Vivolo.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">I am an ex- product development engineer turned software engineer.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">My transition to software started when I witnessed friends of mine making a similar switch. They sparked in me a curiosity about software which laid dormant since early college. Inspired to expand my technological horizons, I found the most recommended and accessible programming tools (i.e. Python with its endless packages and support network) and began to experiment.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">I was hooked instantly.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">For months, every free moment was filled with Leetcode and pet projects: a shell poker game (the engine for my hold&#x27;em project), a shortest-path finder, a web workout tracking interface... With rapidly growing proficiency, I was able to use my newfound talents at my company by creating productivity-boosting apps/services for various departments. After launching several of these to unanimous approval, I saw the light. Developing and launching impactful applications to satisfied users was my calling.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">With every opportunity, I pitched apps and services that could best solve a team&#x27;s problem. The benefits of my offerings were felt, and leaders in the company were quick to approve development of more digital tools.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">I have never been more excited and engaged, both personally and professionally. Having designed, developed, and launched applications that include GUIs, servers, data pipelines, automations, API integrations, and most recently machine learning algorithms, I am eager to apply the skills I&#x27;ve learned in a dedicated role. The tools which made me a successful engineer and leader in industrial product development no doubt transfer. I look forward to growing and helping others grow the same; especially if that means having the courage to take a leap in order to pursue what will be truly fulfilling.</p>
                        <p class="mb-4">On a more personal note, as much as I enjoy programming, balance is key to a long and happy life. Outside of work, you&#x27;ll find me playing chess, reading an interesting book (currently braving The Brothers Karamazov), cooking up a new meal, or hitting the golf course. I value quality time with family and friends like visiting the parents for dinner on the weekends or heading into the city to explore unseen locations. What I&#x27;m most excited about is the trip to Japan my girlfriend and I are planning later this year.</p>
